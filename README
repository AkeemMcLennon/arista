terminal-based transcoding. Settings are chosen based on output device and 
quality preset.

module to your python site-packages or dist-packages path, install the arista 
programs into sys.prefix/bin and install presets and graphics into 
sys.prefix/share/arista.

There are two clients available, a graphical client using GTK+ and a terminal 
client. The graphical client is failry self-explanatory and can be launched 
with:

    arista-gtk

To use the terminal client please see:

    arista-transcode --help

An example of using the terminal client:

    arista-transcode --device=ipod --preset=low test.mp4 test-ipod.m4v

Other usefule terminal options:

    arista-transcode --info
    arista-transcode --info ipod

Generating a Test File
----------------------
Sometimes it may be useful to generate a test file:

    gst-launch-0.10 videotestsrc num-buffers=500 ! x264enc ! mp4mux ! filesink location=test.mp4

Creating New Device Presets
---------------------------
New device presets can be created by specifying information about yourself and 
the device you wish to support along with presets that describe how to create a
proper gstreamer pipeline to encode for the device in an xml file. Please see 
the xml files in the presets directory that ship with Arista for examples.
